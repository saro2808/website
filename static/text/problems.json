Let \\(U\\) be the external homothety center of \\(\\mu_a\\) and \\(\\nu_c\\), and \\(T\\) be\n        that of \\(\\mu_c\\) and \\(\\nu_a\\). Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \\(U\\ne T\\). Assume\n        that the \\(T, U, A, C\\) succeed in this order. Let the second common external tangent of \\(\\mu_a\\)\n        and \\(\\nu_c\\) intersect \\(BD\\) and \\(BE\\) in \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) respectively. Similarly define \\(S\\)\n        and \\(R\\).

It remains to note that \\(I\\) is the\n        radical center of the circles \\(BJ_aJ_c, BK_aK_c\\) and \\(A_eC_dK_aJ_c\\) therefore the first two\n        circles concur on \\(BI\\) second time.\n    </p>",

Now it is equivalent to the following theorem:</p>\n    <p>\n        <b>Theorem.</b> The isogonal conjugate of any point \\(X\\) on the circumsphere \\(\\Omega\\)\n        of the isosceles tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\) lies on \\(\\Omega\\), that is the circumsphere of\n        isosceles tetrahedron is invariant wrt isogonal conjugacy.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <b>Proof.</b> Let \\(O\\) be the center of \\(\\Omega\\). Let \\(Y\\) be the second point of\n        intersection of \\(\\Omega\\) and the line through \\(D\\) passing through the isogonal\n        conjugate of \\(X\\). The points \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) lie in isogonal planes wrt each of the\n        dihedrons \\(DA, DB, DC\\).

Consider the hexahedron case (figure 1).

Thus the touch-points of these faces with \\(\\omega\\)\n        are coplanar. Hence the pair of lines among \\(l_1, l_2, l_3\\) corresponding to these\n        faces, say \\(l_1, l_2\\), is concurrent. Similarly the other two pairs are concurrent too\n        whence all three \\(l_1, l_2, l_3\\) are concurrent in a point \\(P\\) (since these lines are\n        not coplanar).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Consider the section of the quadrihedron with vertex \\(S\\) by the plane through \\(l_1, l_2\\).\n        Clearly it is a circumscribed quadrilateral. It is well-known that its diagonals are\n        concurrent in the point of intersection of the lines joining the touch-points of opposite\n        sides with the incircle, i.e. in \\(P\\). Hence \\(P\\) lies in the plane \\(ACA_1C_1\\). Similarly\n        \\(P\\) lies in the planes \\(ABA_1B_1\\) and \\(BCB_1C_1\\). Hence \\(P\\) is the intersection point\n        of these three planes and all the diagonals of the hexahedron pass through it.\n    </p>\n    <figure style=\"float:right;\">\n        <img src=\"../../static/images/problem72pic2.png\" style=\"width:350px;\">\n        <figcaption style=\"text-align:center;\">Figure 2</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>\n        Now proceed to the dodecahedron case. Let \\(A, B, C, D, E, F, A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1, E_1, F_1\\)\n        be the touch-points of the faces with \\(\\omega\\) so that \\(X\\) and \\(X_1\\) lie in opposite\n        faces for each \\(X\\in\\{A, B, C, D, E, F\\}\\), the points \\(A, B, C, D, E\\) (in this order) lie\n        in the adjacent faces of \\(F\\).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Denote by \\(\\mathcal Q\\) the icosahedron (dual to the dodecahedron) having these \\(12\\)\n        touch-points as its vertices (figure 2). Let \\(f\\) be a face of the dodecahedron. Denote by \\(T_1, T_2,\n        T_3, T_4, T_5\\) the touch-points of \\(\\omega\\) with the faces adjacent to \\(f\\). According\n        to lemma 2 the extensions of these five faces are concurrent in a point \\(S\\) through \\(T_i,\n        i\\in[5]\\). This means that \\(T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4, T_5\\) lie on the tangent circle of \\(\\omega\\)\n        and the cone with vertex \\(S\\). Hence \\(\\mathcal Q\\) has the property that for any of its\n        vertices its five adjacent vertices are concyclic.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Invert with center \\(F_1\\). Denote by \\(X'\\) the image of \\(X\\). Under this inversion all\n        the vertices of \\(\\mathcal Q\\) except for \\(F_1\\) are sent to the plane \\(\\omega'\\). The\n        circles \\(F_1A_1DEC_1\\), \\(F_1B_1EAD_1\\), \\(F_1C_1ABE_1\\), \\(F_1D_1BCA_1\\), \\(F_1E_1CDB_1\\)\n        become the lines \\(A_1'D'E'C_1'\\), \\(B_1'E'A'D_1'\\), \\(C_1'A'B'E_1'\\), \\(D_1'B'C'A_1'\\),\n        \\(E_1'C'D'B_1'\\) which make the pentagon \\(A'B'C'D'E'\\) and the inscribed star\n        \\(A_1'B_1'C_1'D_1'E_1'\\). Furthermore the quadrilaterals \\(A'D_1'E_1'C'\\), \\(B'E_1'A_1'D'\\),\n        \\(C'A_1'B_1'E'\\), \\(D'B_1'C_1'A'\\), \\(E'C_1'D_1'B'\\) passing through \\(F_1\\) are inscribed\n        too. Hence\n        \\[\\angle A'B'C'=\\angle C'D'E'=\\angle E'A'B'=\\angle B'C'D'=\\angle D'E'A'.\\]\n        From these equalities and the fact that \\(A'B'C'D'E'\\) is inscribed we deduce that each four\n        of its vertices form an isosceles trapezoid whence this pentagon is regular. This means that\n        \\(A_1'B_1'C_1'D_1'E_1'\\) is regular too and that \\(F\\) is its center. Thus \\(A', F', A_1'\\)\n        are collinear, or equivalently \\(A, F, A_1, F_1\\) are concyclic. Consequently the diagonals\n        \\(AA_1\\) and \\(FF_1\\) are concurrent at a point \\(P\\). Similarly we get the concurrencies of the\n        diagonal pairs \\(AA_1, BB_1\\) and \\(FF_1, BB_1\\). Since \\(AA_1, BB_1, FF_1\\) are not coplanar,\n        \\(BB_1\\) passes through \\(P\\). Similarly all the other diagonals pass through \\(P\\).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Now let \\(e\\) and \\(e_1\\) be opposite edges of the dodecahedron. Let \\(X, Y\\) be the\n        touch-points of \\(\\omega\\) with the tangent planes through \\(e\\). Similarly define \\(X_1,\n        Y_1\\).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Since the planes \\(Xe, Ye, X_1e_1, Y_1, e_1\\) are concurrent in the vertex \\(S\\) of the cone\n        that touches \\(\\omega\\) by the circle \\(XYX_1Y_1\\), the extensions of \\(e\\) and \\(e_1\\) pass\n        through \\(S\\). Similarly \\(P\\) lies in the other planes joining opposite edges of the\n        dodecahedron whence \\(P\\) lies on each of the diagonals.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <b>Note.</b> For any vertex of the considered dodecahedron its five adjacent vertices are\n        coplanar. Indeed, denote each vertex by the triple of touch-points with the adjacent faces.\n        Thus we need to prove that, for example the points \\(ABD_1, BCE_1, CDA_1, DEB_1, EAC_1\\) are\n        coplanar, or equivalently that the homonym face-planes of \\(\\mathcal Q\\) are concurrent (due\n        to polar duality). Inverting with center \\(F\\) they become five spheres. We know that both\n        \\(A_1B_1C_1D_1E_1\\) and \\(ABCDE\\) are regular pentagons with center \\(F_1\\). Assume hereafter\n        that \\(X\\) is the image of \\(X\\). Let \\(B_2\\) be the second intersection point of the circles\n        \\(ABD_1\\) and \\(BCE_1\\). Clearly \\(B, B_2, F_1\\) are collinear. Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) be the\n        second intersection points of \\(F_1F\\) with the spheres \\(ABD_1F\\) and \\(BCE_1F\\) respectively.\n        We have \\(F_1F\\cdot F_1X=F_1B_2\\cdot F_1B=F_1F\\cdot F_1Y\\) so \\(X\\equiv Y\\). Similarly the\n        other spheres too pass through \\(X\\equiv Y\\).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Thanks to this property one can note that, for example the extensions of faces corresponding\n        to \\(F\\) and \\(F_1\\), as well as the planes \\(ABCDE\\) and \\(A_1B_1C_1D_1E_1\\) share a common\n        line (the polar line of \\(FF_1\\) wrt \\(\\omega\\)).\n    </p>",

We have\n        \\begin{equation}\n        \\label{eq}\n        DM\\ge DH.\\tag{*}\n        \\end{equation}\n        By the tetrahedron median formula\n        \\[DM^2=\\frac{3(DA^2+DB^2+DC^2)-(AB^2+BC^2+CA^2)}{9}=\\frac29 (a^2+b^2+c^2).\\]\n        Let's calculate \\(DH\\). To do so draw a plane through each edge of \\(ABCD\\) parallel to the opposite edge.\n        These planes form a parallelepiped. Using the characteristic property of parallelogram for each of its\n        faces, that is the sum of squares of diagonals equals the sum of squares of sides, we get that for the\n        edges \\(u, v, w\\) of the parallelepiped are equal to\n        \\[u=\\sqrt{\\frac{AB^2+CD^2+AC^2+BD^2-BC^2-AD^2}{2}}=\\sqrt{c^2+b^2-a^2}.\\]\n        and so on. \\(ABCD\\) is an isosceles tetrahedron so its circumscribed parallelepiped is rectangular and\n        its volume is \\(uvw\\) which is the third of the volume \\(V\\) of \\(ABCD\\). At last the area of \\(ABC\\) is\n        \\[S=\\frac{\\sqrt{(a+b+c)(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)}}{4}.\\]\n        Hence inserting the value \\(DH=3V/S\\) into \\eqref{eq} we get the desired inequality.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <b>Note.</b> The distance \\(\\rho\\) between the circumcenter and the centroid of \\(ABC\\) is equal to\n        \\(MH/2\\) so\n        \\[\\rho^2=\\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{18}-\\frac{(-a^2+b^2+c^2)(a^2-b^2+c^2)(a^2+b^2-c^2)}{2(a+b+c)\n        (-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)}.\\]\n    </p>",
