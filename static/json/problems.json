Let \\(U\\) be the external homothety center of \\(\\mu_a\\) and \\(\\nu_c\\), and \\(T\\) be\n        that of \\(\\mu_c\\) and \\(\\nu_a\\). Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \\(U\\ne T\\).

It remains to note that \\(I\\) is the\n        radical center of the circles \\(BJ_aJ_c, BK_aK_c\\) and \\(A_eC_dK_aJ_c\\) therefore the first two\n        circles concur on \\(BI\\) second time.\n    </p>",

Let \\(A, B, C, D, E, F, A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1, E_1, F_1\\)\n        be the touch-points of the faces with \\(\\omega\\) so that \\(X\\) and \\(X_1\\) lie in opposite\n        faces for each \\(X\\in\\{A, B, C, D, E, F\\}\\), the points \\(A, B, C, D, E\\) (in this order) lie\n        in the adjacent faces of \\(F\\).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Denote by \\(\\mathcal Q\\) the icosahedron (dual to the dodecahedron) having these \\(12\\)\n        touch-points as its vertices (figure 2). Let \\(f\\) be a face of the dodecahedron. Denote by \\(T_1, T_2,\n        T_3, T_4, T_5\\) the touch-points of \\(\\omega\\) with the faces adjacent to \\(f\\). According\n        to lemma 2 the extensions of these five faces are concurrent in a point \\(S\\) through \\(T_i,\n        i\\in[5]\\). This means that \\(T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4, T_5\\) lie on the tangent circle of \\(\\omega\\)\n        and the cone with vertex \\(S\\). Hence \\(\\mathcal Q\\) has the property that for any of its\n        vertices its five adjacent vertices are concyclic.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Invert with center \\(F_1\\). Denote by \\(X'\\) the image of \\(X\\). Under this inversion all\n        the vertices of \\(\\mathcal Q\\) except for \\(F_1\\) are sent to the plane \\(\\omega'\\). The\n        circles \\(F_1A_1DEC_1\\), \\(F_1B_1EAD_1\\), \\(F_1C_1ABE_1\\), \\(F_1D_1BCA_1\\), \\(F_1E_1CDB_1\\)\n        become the lines \\(A_1'D'E'C_1'\\), \\(B_1'E'A'D_1'\\), \\(C_1'A'B'E_1'\\), \\(D_1'B'C'A_1'\\),\n        \\(E_1'C'D'B_1'\\) which make the pentagon \\(A'B'C'D'E'\\) and the inscribed star\n        \\(A_1'B_1'C_1'D_1'E_1'\\). Furthermore the quadrilaterals \\(A'D_1'E_1'C'\\), \\(B'E_1'A_1'D'\\),\n        \\(C'A_1'B_1'E'\\), \\(D'B_1'C_1'A'\\), \\(E'C_1'D_1'B'\\) passing through \\(F_1\\) are inscribed\n        too. Hence\n        \\[\\angle A'B'C'=\\angle C'D'E'=\\angle E'A'B'=\\angle B'C'D'=\\angle D'E'A'.\\]\n        From these equalities and the fact that \\(A'B'C'D'E'\\) is inscribed we deduce that each four\n        of its vertices form an isosceles trapezoid whence this pentagon is regular. This means that\n        \\(A_1'B_1'C_1'D_1'E_1'\\) is regular too and that \\(F\\) is its center. Thus \\(A', F', A_1'\\)\n        are collinear, or equivalently \\(A, F, A_1, F_1\\) are concyclic. Consequently the diagonals\n        \\(AA_1\\) and \\(FF_1\\) are concurrent at a point \\(P\\). Similarly we get the concurrencies of the\n        diagonal pairs \\(AA_1, BB_1\\) and \\(FF_1, BB_1\\). Since \\(AA_1, BB_1, FF_1\\) are not coplanar,\n        \\(BB_1\\) passes through \\(P\\). Similarly all the other diagonals pass through \\(P\\).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Now let \\(e\\) and \\(e_1\\) be opposite edges of the dodecahedron. Let \\(X, Y\\) be the\n        touch-points of \\(\\omega\\) with the tangent planes through \\(e\\). Similarly define \\(X_1,\n        Y_1\\).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Since the planes \\(Xe, Ye, X_1e_1, Y_1, e_1\\) are concurrent in the vertex \\(S\\) of the cone\n        that touches \\(\\omega\\) by the circle \\(XYX_1Y_1\\), the extensions of \\(e\\) and \\(e_1\\) pass\n        through \\(S\\). Similarly \\(P\\) lies in the other planes joining opposite edges of the\n        dodecahedron whence \\(P\\) lies on each of the diagonals.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <b>Note.</b> For any vertex of the considered dodecahedron its five adjacent vertices are\n        coplanar. Indeed, denote each vertex by the triple of touch-points with the adjacent faces.\n        Thus we need to prove that, for example the points \\(ABD_1, BCE_1, CDA_1, DEB_1, EAC_1\\) are\n        coplanar, or equivalently that the homonym face-planes of \\(\\mathcal Q\\) are concurrent (due\n        to polar duality). Inverting with center \\(F\\) they become five spheres. We know that both\n        \\(A_1B_1C_1D_1E_1\\) and \\(ABCDE\\) are regular pentagons with center \\(F_1\\). Assume hereafter\n        that \\(X\\) is the image of \\(X\\). Let \\(B_2\\) be the second intersection point of the circles\n        \\(ABD_1\\) and \\(BCE_1\\). Clearly \\(B, B_2, F_1\\) are collinear. Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) be the\n        second intersection points of \\(F_1F\\) with the spheres \\(ABD_1F\\) and \\(BCE_1F\\) respectively.\n        We have \\(F_1F\\cdot F_1X=F_1B_2\\cdot F_1B=F_1F\\cdot F_1Y\\) so \\(X\\equiv Y\\). Similarly the\n        other spheres too pass through \\(X\\equiv Y\\).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Thanks to this property one can note that, for example the extensions of faces corresponding\n        to \\(F\\) and \\(F_1\\), as well as the planes \\(ABCDE\\) and \\(A_1B_1C_1D_1E_1\\) share a common\n        line (the polar line of \\(FF_1\\) wrt \\(\\omega\\)).\n    </p>",
